    <h2>Pepperoni Pizza Recipe</h2>
    <p>This is my family pizza recipe. Buckle up!</p>
    <ul>Thing's you'll need:
        <li>Flour</li>
        <li>Water</li>
        <li>Pepperoni</li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <ol>Let's get cooking!
        <li>Start out with about 12-16 ounces of dough. I worked really hard to perfect my Pizza Dough recipe and <em>highly</em> recommend it! But any pizza dough, homemade or store bought, will work for this recipe.</li>
        <li>Mix all the shit together and throw it in the oven.</li>
        <li>Viola! Your pizza is done!</li>
    </ol>
